# Minimum Operations

## Project Overview

This project solves the "Minimum Operations" problem, which requires calculating the minimum number of operations needed to achieve exactly `n` 'H' characters in a text editor. The only operations allowed are "Copy All" and "Paste".

## Problem Statement

Starting with one character 'H', determine the minimum number of operations required to reach exactly `n` characters using the following operations:
1. **Copy All** - Copies all characters in the file.
2. **Paste** - Pastes the copied characters into the file.
